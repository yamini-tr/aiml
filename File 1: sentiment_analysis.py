# Step 1: Sample dataset (you can replace with your own CSV)

        "Worst experience ever, not worth it.",
        "It's okay, not too bad but could be better.",

# Step 2: Train-test split

# Step 3: Text vectorization (TF-IDF)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')

# Step 4: Model training

# Step 5: Prediction and evaluation

# Step 6: Try new reviews
